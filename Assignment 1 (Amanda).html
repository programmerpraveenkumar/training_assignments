        <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
        <p>
          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
          the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
          more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
          including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
        <p>
          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
          it over
          <!-- span tag -->
          <span style="color: red; font-weight: bolder">2000 years old</span>.
          Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
          Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
          from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
          classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
          comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
          Malorum" (<span style="color: blue"
            >The Extremes of Good and Evil</span
          >) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory
          of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of
          Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
          section 1.10.32.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
          below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
          Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
          exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
          translation by H. Rackham.
